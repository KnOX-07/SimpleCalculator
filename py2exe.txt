We can also create an  executable file by following the steps :- 

Step 1: Install PyInstaller
Open a command prompt or terminal and run the following command to install PyInstaller:
--> pip install pyinstaller

Step 2: Navigate to your script’s directory
Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where your Python script is located.
>cd path\to\your\script

Step 3: Run PyInstaller
Run PyInstaller with the following command:
--> python -m PyInstaller --onefile main.py
Replace `your_script.py` with the name of your Python script.
– The `–onefile` flag indicates that you want a single executable file instead of a bunch of files.

Step 4: Locate the executable
Once PyInstaller has finished, you will find a `dist` directory in your script’s directory.
Inside the `dist` directory, you will see the standalone executable file with the same name as your script but with a `.exe` extension.
